                Purpose: Social Media Replacement
            </dt>
            <dd>
                MySoloNetwork is simply a tool for those who no longer want to use other social media applications, but
                still want to use the services that they're used to.
                Many news outlets and former social media influencers have begun to leave social media, and report the
                negative affects that social media applications have on the human mind. MySoloNetwork is meant to be a
                freely-available solution for those who feel social media applications represent a problem in their
                life.

                What's wrong with Social Media?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <b>Nothing, if you have something to sell.</b><br />
                You must realize that social media businesses are just that, businesses. They are not your friend. Their
                sole purpose is to generate profit for their investors. While they provide beneficial services to the
                public, the services aren't provided for the public's benefit. They're provided so the social media
                companies can learn as much as they can about their users, and sell that information to the highest
                bidder. They make a lot of money, because they know a lot about their users. Social media application
                users share their "secret" conversations, cherished photographic moments (along with the metadata
                attached to those cherished moments), and even their 24/7 GPS wherabouts. They're not just sharing this
                information with their friends. They're freely sharing/giving their information to an advertising
                company! So you can't really expect said company to do nothing with the information that you're freely
                providing them. They use the information to sell your attention to others who want to present something
                to you (i.e. an advertisement, a targeted news article, etc.). So if you're a busines that has a message
                to present, social media applications provide a valuable lead-generation service for you. But with that
                said...
            </dd>

            <dt>
                If you're not selling, you're being sold.
            </dt>
            <dd>
                There's no other way around it. Social Media companies earn revenue based on their user's attendance and
                attention. Their provided services are the bait used to encourage the public's constant engagement with
                their company. And the intention for the engagement is soley profit, not the public's benefit.
                <br />
                As long as you know and accept this, before you utilize social media services, then there is nothing
                wrong with using social media. Otherwise, social media apps are something you may want to avoid.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                What if you're already on social media?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                You have to be honest with yourself, and understand how you feel before, during, and after using social
                media. Do you feel good about yourself and others? There are many reports of how social media
                applications have made people become meaner, more anxious, and more depressed. If this describes how you
                feel or have felt, psychologists advise you to step away from social media. Which is actually the
                correct solution. But how? Social Media is everywhere. Your search engine is a social media application.
                Your email service probably is as well. And if most of your finances and other accounts are attached to
                your email, it becomes even harder to break from using social media services. Thus, making it an
                addiction.

                Social Media Addiction
            </dt>
            <dd>
                People have become addicted to certain social media platforms, in an unhealthy manner. Social Media
                applications can be considered technically the same as drugs... Mind-altering substances. With the
                addictive nature of the Internet and social media, getting a long-time social media user to step away
                from social media may be as hard as getting a long-time drug user to step away from using drugs. You
                can't expect either to successfully quit, cold-turkey, on their own. Then how?

                Social Media Addiction Treatment
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Just as there are drug-addiction treatment facilities, Internet Addiction (IA) treatment facilities have
                begun to sprout up across the world. And many successes have been documented from them. Unfortunately,
                these IA treatment facilities are extremely cost-prohibitive. The cost for a 30-day intensive therapy
                program to treat IA runs about $30,000. And the cost probably isn't covered by health insurance. That's
                because Internet Addiction, while being a real thing, is not yet officially recognized as a diagnosable
                mental health conditon. Having to spend over 30 grand in order to heal yourself from issues caused by a
                free service is both insane, as well as the world we currently live in. There has to be a free solution
                to address the problem of Internet and Social Media Addiction. This is where MySoloNetwork comes in.

                MySoloNetwork
            </dt>
            <dd>
                MySoloNetwork is designed to be a free Social Media Addiction Treatment approach. When you get down to
                it, it's simply a social-media-like website, that you can run on your computer (with or without the
                Internet) or web hosting account (i.e. GoDaddy account). It provides those who want to stop using social
                media applications the ability to still utilize the core features that social media companies use to
                keep their users addicted. All while allowing the person to do so safely. How?

                The Difference:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <b>Completely Solo Network.</b>
                This application is simply a website that allow you perform the same core tasks that can do with a
                social media app:
                <ul>
                    <li>Post Status Updates</li>
                    <li>Upload Images and create Image Albums</li>
                    <li>Write and save Notes.</li>
                    <li>Post upcoming and past Events</li>
                    <li>Calendar (New Feature) - You can review your usage, much easier than you can on other social
                        media sites. By seeing how many, and what type of posts you made on a given day, it allows you
                        to monitor the usage of your time.</li>
                    <li>Most importantly, you keep your data! All of your data stay with you, on your device. [For the
                        technical people,] MySoloNetwork is a Microsoft ASP.NET Blazor application that stores data in
                        SQLite database files. You can run this application from your computer, completely without the
                        use for the Internet. Or you can make MySoloNetwork your public-facing website. Either way, All
                        of the data you enter stays with you and isn't sold to third parties. No analytic data is
                        captured/tracked with the use of this application (other than timestamps of when data is
                        created/updated, and the data Microsoft collects, if any). There is no advertising model
                        developed for this application. So your actions will not be used to influence/manipulate either
                        you or those who view your site.</li>

                What's Missing?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                What's missing from MySoloNetwork, are the negative affects you encounter while using social media:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>No Negative feedback.</b> Because there's no feedback at all. There's no Comment section. And
                        there's no Like button. People are more cruel online. Negative online feedback from others can
                        lead you down the path to poor mental health and low self-esteem. So there is no "Comment"
                        section in this application. There is no "Like Button" in this application. If someone has
                        something to say about what you post, they can feel free to tell you in-person.</li>
                    <li>Only the user can post on there site. So there's no chance of being affected by the spreading
                        dangerous misinformation by others. </li>
                    <li><b>NO NOTIFICATIONS!</b> Social Media companies use notification messages as a way to force
                        constant engagement and occupy your time. This application is meant to help remove your
                        dependence/addiction to these types of unethical techniques.</li>
                    <li><b>No Friends List.</b> Online Friends Lists tend to spill out into real life. If someone
                        "Un-Friends" you online, you can tend to end your actual friendship with that person. The
                        Internet should not have that power over your real life. Since this application is designed to
                        be a "solo-network," rather than social network, no ability to link to the solo-network sites of
                        others was developed. If you want to have click-able access to the solo-network sites of others,
                        you can always use web browser bookmarks.</li>
                    <li><b>Completely Free!</b> The source code is freely available for self-review and use.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                And above all, you are asked to use this application for nothing but good. Many hours were spent
                creating this application to be a step in the right direction, when it comes to the world's mental
                health. Please use it to make yourself a better person. 
                If alterations are made to the code, it is asked that the text of this About page remains visible and in-tact 
                (in order to spread the message of conquering Internet and Social Media Addiction).
